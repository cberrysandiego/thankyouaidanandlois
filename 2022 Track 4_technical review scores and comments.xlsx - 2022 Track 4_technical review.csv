The strengths of this application are potential. It is dedicated to working closely with one school in the community in order to establish a system. However, it could be improved by demonstrating a clear relationship and reciprocity of the relationship. While the potential is there, as it is, it is not clear whether that potential can be realized. It would be great to gain some perspective to see whether the school share similar vision to improving the food supply. If not, the project might not be fruitful as hoped. In the end, this application would need to demonstrate that the narrow scope of the vision is worth the investment to create a strong system that can be expanded to other communities.",

While the application highlights the applicant's strong and large network of partners, it is unclear whether the relationship is reciprocated, and the partners are on board with the curriculum proposals. Given the outlined projects involve large commitment of the school districts to alter and promote new curriculums, it is very important for them to be on the same page. Also, it is questionable whether the curriculum would be popular among students (will it be elective? compulsory?). It would be great to have some background information into whether these types of courses and curriculum will be of interest from students' perspectives. In the end, this application has interesting ideas and promises. It would be great to see it further developed.",

The strengths of this application are:
1. I have given a full score for making the case to many of the grants that I have reviewed because they all have a unique perspective and address the needs and gaps in their businesses and communities. But if I could give an extra point for section 11. of this grant, I would. This grantee describes a number of issues that they wish to address, including childhood obesity, pesticide exposure in farm communities (which I know is a greater factor in this area of California), the CalEnvioroScreen 4.0 rating for pollution, and their support for farmworkers acheiving economic stability. They really do a good job of explaining these factors, and are purposeful in their approach to address these.
2. The climate smart agriculture description is very robust, including organic certification, adding carbon into the soil through cover cropping, adding compost, and keeping the soil covered, planting hedgerows, and employing water use efficient practices.
3. The grant provides a clear and compelling case for needed infrastructure improvements leading to doubling sales to schools.
4. There are multiple letters of intent indicating that schools will both purchase produce and organize on-farm visits to the farm.
However, it could be improved by: 
1. There is no description of the on-farm educational opportunities that the farmer collective will provide in the project narrative. It is described in the timeline, but I deducted a point because the two sections didn't align completely.
2. The grant applicant failed to fill out the reasoning to justify the proposed costs. These are well-explained in the project narrative, but I deducted all the points in order to follow the scoring instructions. 
In the end, this application is very compelling, and deserves consideration even though information is missing from the budget justification section, especially since this information is well-explained in the project narrative.","This is a very compelling grant, but due to what I am sure is an accidental omission in the budget justification section, it hasn't scored as well as others in the budget section.

Karen Adler,Codi Hale,Resource Conservation Foundation of Greater San Diego,type:individual,9/11/2022,No,5,2,3,10,2,2,7,0,2,1,4,2,40,"I do recommend this applicant for further consideration. Except for a small deduction because the narrative/timeline lacked information about the specific staff listed in the budget who would be involved in the various aspects of the project, this application received the highest points I could give it. This project is essentially trying to purchase equipment and add staff support to cultivate a fallow 1.5 acre plot solely for the purpose of Farm to School sales, and will add additional educational activities to an already active program. The RCD is trying to partner with new farmers to support agricultural vocational opportunities, and is even considering renting the equipment to those who need it to support new growers.
The strengths of this application are:
1. The grantee describes a robust vision and discusses important gaps and needs that this project fulfills, including increasing access to nutritious food, promoting climate smart agricultural practices, and supporting agricultural vocational programs.
2. Narrative and timeline are full of specific details about both increasing food to the school district partner and providing on-farm educational opportunities that lead to outreach events at school gardens. The information is detailed, and shows that a considerable amount of thought has gone into planning this project. The narrative and timeline align completely.
3. The fact that all the staff positions listed on the grant are existing positions is nice to see, as it shows that these positions do not require the grant funds for funding. The fact that this is an RCD grant, and the RCD has a lot of partnerships that can help to sustain this work adds to the sustainability of the project.
However, it could be improved by: 
1. The budget lists five staff members who will be paid by the grant for managing procurement, managing the farm, acting as a farm educator, and providing grant management. These staff positions are never explicitly mentioned in the narrative/timeline, and while they are alluded to, I deducted 2 points for not clearly explaining how each of these positions will be involved. However, the explanations listed in the budget do make these relationships clear. I evaluated other grants similarly, so I deducted points to maintain consistency, but overall, I think the budget explanations, when looked at with the narrative/timeline, explain the project well and cover all necessary details.
In the end, this application is solid, and if approved, would increase food production and educational opportunities for students.",

1. The applicant presents a clear project and timeline to address gaps that are preventing the 8 acre school farm from selling produce to the partnering high school.
2. The project outlines a goal of obtaining sustainable funding from the contract with the school Food Service provider that can sustain staffing and project goals once fixed costs like irrigation improvements, a food safety plan, and negotiating/planning the contract are paid for by the grant.
3. The grant outlines straightforward climate smart improvements focused on water use efficiency and to a lesser extent, composting, that would benefit the farm while mitigating GHG emissions.
4. The school serves disadvantaged and low-income communities.

However, it could be improved by:
1. Some duplicate language from the budget example was left in the explanation for mileage- seems pretty clear that this was an editing error. 
2. The sustainability plan score was reduced by a point because there wasn't a clear discussion of how staffing would be sustained.

Karen Adler,Edith Higgins,Edith Higgins,type:individual,9/11/2022,No,5,2,2,10,2,2,7,7,2,1,6,2,48,"I recommend this applicant for further consideration, but with some concerns. I am confused about this grant's sales/donation of whole or minimally processed foods for schools. The Letter of Intent states that the school doesn't intend to purchase or accept whole or minimally processed food products from the grant applicant for school meals. From my read of the application, it appears that pepperoni will be donated during monthly educational activities as part of a hands-on, in-school activity to make pizza. The grant mentions that pepperoni from the farm will be used in this lesson on pizza, and this corresponds to the language in the Letter of Intent, but there is no request for funding for lesson supplies like the meat on the budget, nor can I find where the grant explicitly explains that the pepperoni will be donated. However, the sustainability plan and question before it indicate that there will be income from selling produce to schools, and the grant applicant wants to use the investments made from grant funding to increase production in order to sell to other schools in northern California. Based on these contradictory statements, I am uncertain if the donation/sales of beef to schools is well developed enough, which weakens the grant application considerably. 
I did my best to score this grant given the challenges listed above.

The strengths of this application are:
1. The grant applicant discusses the needs for scaling up beef production in order to sell to schools, and describes educational activities that would correspond with future sales.
2. There is a lot of interesting educational curriculum ideas about cattle discussed, and the product is a unique and important ingredient to source locally for farm to school programs.

However, it could be improved by:
1. I am confused by the way this grant is presenting the sales and/or donations of pepperoni from the producer. Due to this, I almost reduced the narrative score. In the end, since the grant applicant talks about providing pepperoni for a pizza-making monthly activity at schools, I kept the 10 point score, but am on the fence about it. See above for a more detailed discussion. 
2. The applicant makes the case that schools need access to fresh, local beef, and that education about ranching is needed in a ranching community. The explanation then focuses on the specific needs of the operation. I reduced a point because the explanation focused more on the needs of the operation than larger farm to school issues.
In the end, I think this grant has a lot of potential, but the farm to school produce sales/donations lacks explanation.","The budget is essentially supplies and an electrical contractor, so there is no information that clarifies food donations or sales. I gave a full score for the budget because all the supplies listed in the narrative/timeline were also listed on the budget, and the explanations for the need for these was clear. 

This application is completely focused on infrastructure investments to increase beef production, as well as in-classroom and on-farm educational activities. I wish the applicant had spent more time discussing the food donations that are/will be occurring as well as future plans to use the investments from the grant to sell beef to schools. There is information about both of these in different sections of the grant, but the grant focuses much more attention on the educational opportunities than the sales/donations."

The strengths of this application are: 
1. There is a lot of information about on-farm and classroom educational activities.
2. The grant applicant is using climate smart practices like composting and is working to transition to organic.
3. The grantee is offering tomato sauce to schools from tomatoes grown on her farm, which is unique and shelf stable. This adds potential utility for the product when sold to schools.
However, it could be improved by: 
1. It is confusing that the grantee says that she is under contract with NRCS for an agricultural lands-organic subaccount grant, and also states that she has submitted an application to obtain organic certification, but then states that she is not participating in a transitional organic program. Perhaps it is too early to officially say that? I accepted that the producer is transitioning to organic as part of the climate smart practices that they currently use.
2. It would have been nice if the grantee had explained the specific permaculture processes that she uses that are climage smart agricultural practices. I know that permaculture encourages cover cropping and sheet mulching, but I'm not sure if the grantee employs these specific practices. That said, I gave the point for future climate smart agriculture because the farm will transition to organic and appears to have a contract to do this.
In the end, this application is interesting and unique. As long as tomato sauce qualifies as minimally processed, this grant project offers an interesting model that includes a shelf stable product that can be used in kitchens like spaghetti and pizza, and offers corresponding educational opportunities in pizza making, greenhouse production etc. The grantee describes that with these one time investments, she can source to numerous schools in northern California, which would create a sustainable model to pay for ongoing staffing.","I realized that I misunderstood question 17. The applicant stated ""Women"" so I resubmitted this grant a second time giving her points for this question.

I guess if this application made it to me, then you have determined that tomato sauce is considered a ""minimally processed"" food. From the direct marketing perspective (CDFA Certified Farmers' Markets), creating a sauce would be processing a product, but there is no definition for ""minimally processed"". From a practical perspective, I would think that drying, juicing, cutting into smaller pieces, pressing etc. would constitute minimal processing. I suppose at its core, creating tomato sauce is boiling tomatoes, and depending on how elaborate you want to get, adding spices and possibly other cut vegetables, and canning. A few more steps than drying, but certainly not the same as creating a meal. Also, creating sauce/canning is a normal part of extending the life of produce, especially on a farm, and tomato sauce is a very practical product. So if this does constitute ""minimally processed"" that would great. I will score it as if it meets the ""minimally processed food"" requirement."

Strengths of the application include:
- The applicant's project involves three local producers, all providing different types of products (meat, flour, and minimally processed produce) to a local school.
- The project proposes a kid-friendly activity (making pizzas using farm-fresh ingredients), to be implemented monthly. The project would provide schools with a healthier version of a product kids likely already like (pizza). 
- The applicant is an established (yet small) business with commercial production systems in place.  
- The applicant outlines clear usage of climate-smart agricultural techniques.
- The applicant intends to expand the program to additional schools once the program generates income. 

Weaknesses: 
- It is not clear whether the applicant's relationship with the proposed school is pre-existent (the applicant alluded to being involved in educational field days with the school but this wasn't well-explained). 
- The ""Farm to School Vision"" section could have included more detail on agricultural education. In this section, the applicant said they are ""open to providing in-classroom instruction on certified organic wheat production and millingâ€ which didn't signify a deep commitment to education. However, the educational component is much clearer in the Project Narrative and Timeline sections of the application. 
- The ""Making the Case"" section of the application could have been stronger. The applicant listed the lack of mills in the area (and lack of education about milling) as the biggest gap the project will fill. The applicant could have included information about improved nutrition, food security, etc. to make the case for the project stronger. 

In the end, the applicant proposed a clear, feasible project with high potential for success. However, a few questions should be addressed (see the ""additional comments"") before the project is funded. ","I was confused by the ownership structure, and the need for the applicant to rent space at Sunset Ranch. From the application, it seemed as though the applicant owns Sunset Ranch, where Mile High Mill and Grain is already located.

1. The timeline lacks the timing for when the owner takes a food safety course, but otherwise, everything aligns and is explained in both the narrative and the timeline. Due to the fact that this is a very small part of the plan, I didn't deduct a point.
2. The supplies section of the grant was thorough and specific to each item on the spreadsheet.
3. I reduced the budget score due to the addition of certain supplies like soil amendment, a laptop, a printer, and office supplies that weren't mentioned in the project description section, although they were explained in the budget section. There is a general description of time-saving, climate-smart tools with examples in question 11, but these aren't elaborated on in the narrative or timeline. They are explained in detail in the budget.
In the end, this application lacks a little bit of explanation in the project description that aligns with the budget, but overall, it is a strong application.",

The strengths of this application are:
1. The grant applicant has a lot of enthusiasm for the work, and demonstrates a clear, established pathway for selling produce to schools and a need for additional LED lights to support these contracts year round.
2. The letters of intent all describe schools that are planning to source local produce and build educational programs around the produce that is procured.
However, it could be improved by:
1. The project narrative explained the school education component of the grant, but the timeline was vague about when these activities would occur. It gave the impression that the timing and specifics of these activities hadn't been determined. The budget also didn't allot any funding for educational time by the owners or staff of the business, which also gave the impression that the educational activities at the schools weren't as fleshed out as the farm to school produce sales. It appears unclear whether the applicant will provide hands-on educational training or if the school will be leading the activities.
2. The answer to question 15 funding priority for priority populations isn't clear because the applicant failed to put an address of a school down that I could verify. Based on the letter of intent from San Marcos Unified School District, which stated that all 19,500 students would be receiving produce from the grant applicant (I verified that the school district had 19,500 students on the About Us section of the district's website), I determined that Joli Ann Leichtag elementary school at 653 Poinsettia Ave, Vista, CA, 92081, USA does qualify. I gave them 2 points because of this, but am not sure if this was the correct way to determine the points.
","The 18 a. climate smart agriculture contains typos and discusses ground covers, which doesn't intuitively make sense to me in a hydroponic system. It also mentions trapping carbon ""on the roots of our plants"", which sounds to me like photosynthesis, but perhaps they mean carbon sequestration, or it is unclear because of my lack of familiarity with hydroponics.

The strengths of the application include:  
- The applicant proposes an educational program on a multi-use farm, which would provide students the opportunity to learn about a diverse range of farming practices (e.g., raising livestock, tending to orchards, growing vegetables, managing greenhouses.. etc.) 
- The applicant demonstrates a strong commitment to (and usage of) climate-smart agriculture.
- The applicant plans to implement multiple technologies on the farm, which would provide students the opportunity to learn about hydroponics, irrigation,  trimming, planting, and cloning. 

The weaknesses of the application include:  
- The applicant's relationship with school is not very established (they have just previously collaborated on a compost program), and the organization's letter of intent was not very strong. 
- The applicant is not very clear on whether or not they plan to provide produce to local schools. In the Farm to School vision, the applicant mentions their objective is to ""provide schools with local and sustainably produced fruits.â€ However, the school's letter of intent does not include an intention of purchasing produce from the farm. A clear commitment to provide the school with produce would have enhanced the application. The applicant also mentioned an intention to â€œpromote a line of products to local schools.â€ This raised the question of whether or not the relationship with the school was just for marketing. 
- The ""Making the Case"" section of the application could have been stronger. The applicant did not discuss the community served, just the general benefits of agricultural education. 
- The applicant's project narrative only briefly touched on farm improvements, but the budget focuses almost entirely on farm improvements. The budget is well-done, but it should have been more in line with the project narrative and project description. The budget is also over $150,000. 
- The applicant's sustainability plan is not very strong. The applicant mentions ""continu[ing] relationships"" and ""expanding [the] project"" but offers no clear explanation how relationships will be continued and/or how the project will be expanded. 
- The applicant's project centers around teaching students about agricultural technology, but the organization is applying for this grant funding in order to implement the technology. This suggests the organization won't have significant time to use the technology before teaching students about it. 

In the end, this application has more weaknesses than strengths. It would likely make more sense for this organization to apply for farm-to-school grant funding once the climate smart technology is in place, so they have experience implementing it before using it for agricultural education. ",

2. The educational component is impressive- well-thought out, well-described, and includes student farm visits where they get an opportunity to ""be farmers for a day"" and donations of starts and educational support to school gardens.
3. There is a lot of detail about how to extend the season and enhance production in order to increase produce supply to local schools through a school distribution hub- this demonstrates clear intent and a well-established mode of procurement that multiple schools are using to obtain produce.
4. The applicant mentions a number of climate-smart agricultural practices, including transitioning to organic, cover cropping, compost use, and utilizing less water through experimental field studies. 
5. Very clear and thorough explanation about how the grant funding will lead to greater economic sustainability, which will support the staff that are being funded through this grant. There is even mention of the possibility of building one of the staff positions into a full time position, which would increase the time of this position as it is described in the grant, based on these grant funds.
However, it could be improved by: 
1. The budget worksheet for salaries includes information that staff will be paid a certain amount per hour as hourly wages over a period of months, but doesn't specify how many hours each will work. I suppose the total hours can be calculated in reverse if needed? I didn't deduct points.

","I resubmitted this grant with a higher score because I originally misunderstood the question 17 funding priority answer, but realized after I submitted it that the answer given by the grantee does indicate that the project receives funding priority. 

I noticed that this grant applicant received a CDFA Farm to School incubator grant last year. I know there are arguments for not providing additional grant funds to an applicant who already received them when funding is limited and demand and need are so great. On the other hand, with this funding, it seems that this grant applicant can move into a much more economically sustainable model that provides sales to multiple schools and ongoing on-farm and in-class educational activities. It is a hard balance, but I would say that this is a very compelling grant to fund due to how much benefit will come from the grant award, which will support multiple school districts and school farms by allowing them to increase in scale.

Her budget outlines all the infrastructure needed to set up her greenhouse operation. I am a bit concerned about the ability to grow an abundance of crops and fish to supply to the schools however as she is quite new to this technology and does not have a proven track record with this new system. Lots can go wrong with starting a new system and it will take a lot of set up and tweaking. It could be improved by scaling back and not over promising.

The narrative and timeline did not match the services and staff listed in her budget. 
I do not recommend this applicant for further consideration. ","I felt that there were many (more than 5) goals/visions in this application. I could not clearly tell what the goals were for the grant money to be used on and how it would strongly relate to the overall Track 4 grant purposes. Her budget included multiple staff/professionals she planned to hire for various projects but none of these staff were mentioned in her narrative or timeline. She did not list the amount of items requested for some of the lines (i.e. how many trays, how many trees, how many seeds/transplants). I think the application reads as a request to get her farm to the status she would like it to be, but she does not sound prepared to meet one or both of the intentions of Track 4 funding at this current moment."

He should be able to generate income each year after the grant by selling his beef patties to the school districts.

Project strengths include: 
- The applicant has a very strong longstanding relationship with a school district. 
- The applicant outlined a very explicit plan for adopting climate-smart agriculture practices. 

Project weaknesses include: 
- The project seems ambitious â€” the applicant listed at least six major aspects of the project (installing an irrigation system, building an outdoor classroom, educating farmers, installing perennials, implementing other climate-smart agricultural practices, and building out a processing center.) It may be possible for the applicant to complete all of this work with the resources and time provided, but it would be worth looking at the organization's track record of what they can accomplish with the resources and staffing they have. 
- It would have strengthened the application to name specific farms and school districts where education is planned. 
- Much of the project relies on student and volunteer labor which is not highly sustainable (or reliable). 

In the end, this project outlines a well-thought out, yet ambitious plan for increasing farm-to-school produce procurement and agricultural education. ","This application is related to another application in Track 2. 

It was difficult to determine if the area qualifies as socially disadvantaged. The Census track on the map was not colored, but the text said, â€œLow income.â€ The applicant mentions multiple times that the county is on average high income, but there is a large equity gap. "

Their budget identifies increasing purchase of wheat berries from (I'm assuming) local producers and making improvements to their processing line. This would suggest they are a processor.

Strengths of this application include:

- The applicant outlines a very detailed, thought-out plan for an agricultural education curriculum (including information about planting, harvesting, and processing.) 

Weaknesses of the application include:

- It was unclear whether the applicant produces products other than dates â€” if not, it seemed odd that the educational curriculum includes starts for other types of plants. 
- It was unclear how the program will generate income, given so much of the grant funds are to be used for staff income and consumable supplies.

The technical aspects of how they would implement field trips/operations are unclear. One of their vision statement bullets states they want to provide ""entrepreneurial and technical skills"" but they blanket ""field trips"" as an aim to do this, with no breakdown of what is occurring on said field trips. There is also no mention of sustainability of hired manager/staff post-grant.

They also have an Ecological Outcome Verification process. However, it could be improved by justifying the budget items and by outlining a more specific plan for produce growing and distribution. They also have 26 acres in grain and cover crop productions, 100+ cashmere goats, trees planted and can therefore increase their likelihood of agritourism field trips. In the end, they could benefit from the grant monies to jumpstart their CFT vermicompost system and hire a Vermicompost Manager.

Strengths of the application include:

- The proposed project site is located in a disadvantaged and low-income community. 
- The applicant shows a clear commitment to utilizing climate-smart agricultural practices, including current and planned participation in USDA/ CDFA programs. 

Weaknesses of the application include: 
- The applicant's relationship with schools is not longstanding, but strong potential is demonstrated. 
- The sustainability plan could have been stronger. The applicant suggested they will generate revenue with their produce sales to schools, but their budget also includes seed starts (implying money might be needed for planting annual seeds).

The strengths of this application are:
1. The grantee describes the on-farm educational opportunities that will be made available in great depth, including interesting aspects like including Spanish vocabulary for different management practices, describing misconceptions of organic versus non-organic, and discussing food safety practices.
2. The grantee is trying to overcome difficulties in bringing students to the farm safely, and delivering donated produce to a nearby school, which if overcome, would be in line with the goals of this grant.
However, it could be improved by: 
1. The grantee makes the case for the major need for transportation for delivering produce to schools and bringing children to the farm, but doesn't elaborate on this in the project narrative. The grantee also mentions the implementation of an outdoor classroom in the timeline, but this isn't mentioned in the project narrative or making a case answers. Consequently, the grant loses points for the timeline not aligning with the project narrative.
2. I reduced points for the budget/narrative section due to a number of issues. The reasoning for the flatbed truck outfitted for Global Gap compliance in the budget isn't explained in the narrative. I couldn't read the entire budget explanation for the outdoor classroom, but the only mention of it is in the timeline, and the details are minimal. A Farm to Forl [Fork] producer who is paid hourly wages is also listed under staff/labor, but there is no explanation for this role in the narrative or in the budget. Also, insurance costs for the two vehicles to be purchased are explained in the budget, but not mentioned in the narrative. 
In the end, this application lacks important information needed to understand the need for the flatbed truck. The budget and project narrative also don't align very well, and one staff position isn't explained in the budget or narrative.","I wish the grantee had described the need for the flatbed truck more in the project description. The grantee describes the need to have a ""competitive, efficient and reliable source of transportation"" that would result in lower shipping costs and lower food costs, as well as the fact they would deliver fresher produce to their distributors, school and tables. I find this confusing. In the budget, the need for the flatbed truck, which uses more than 40% of the grant funds, is explained by the fact that the grantee needs a flatbed truck especially outfitted to meet food safety guidelines (Global Gap). But without further explanation, I'm not certain if this is critical for the donated produce, which from the grant description, is moving 0.2 miles away to one school, especially since this produce has been donated in the past. I reduced points for making the case for this need, as well as in the budget/narrative section. "
